  <core-architecture>
    <reactive-css-system>
      <css-object-architecture>
        The CSS system is built around JavaScript object representations of CSS rules with automatic class generation and rule management. CSS objects support nested selectors, pseudo-classes, media queries, and arbitrary CSS properties. Unlike traditional CSS-in-JS libraries that require build-time compilation, the system processes objects at runtime with intelligent caching and memoization to maintain performance while enabling dynamic styling.
      </css-object-architecture>
      <css-generation-pipeline>
        The css() function accepts CSS objects and options, generating unique class names and CSS rules. The process() function recursively transforms nested objects into valid CSS strings, handling special cases like pseudo-selectors, media queries, and vendor prefixes. Generated CSS is injected into DOM style elements through reactive computed properties that update automatically when underlying rules change.
      </css-generation-pipeline>
      <reactive-style-binding>
        CSS properties containing signal functions automatically create reactive bindings through the core effect system. When signals change, only affected CSS rules regenerate without reprocessing entire stylesheets. This granular reactivity enables dynamic theming, conditional styling, and responsive design patterns without performance penalties associated with full stylesheet regeneration.
      </reactive-style-binding>
    </reactive-css-system>
    <rule-management-engine>
      <reference-counting-system>
        CSS rules use reference counting to track usage across components and prevent memory leaks. Each generated rule maintains a reference count that increments when css() is called and decrements when css.remove() is executed. Rules with zero references are automatically removed from the DOM, ensuring stylesheets don't accumulate unused rules during component lifecycle changes.
      </reference-counting-system>
      <rule-deduplication>
        Identical CSS objects generate the same rules regardless of call location, with hash-based deduplication preventing duplicate rule insertion. The system maintains a global registry of rule keys mapped to CSS content, enabling efficient lookup and reuse. Reference counting operates on deduplicated rules, ensuring multiple components using identical styles share the same CSS rule.
      </rule-deduplication>
      <scoped-selector-generation>
        Generated class names follow configurable patterns with automatic scoping to prevent global CSS conflicts. The scoped option enables nested selector generation for component isolation. Custom naming through the name option provides predictable class names for debugging and testing. Global styles bypass class generation and inject rules directly into the stylesheet.
      </scoped-selector-generation>
    </rule-management-engine>
    <variable-system>
      <nested-object-flattening>
        The cssVars() function processes nested JavaScript objects into flat CSS custom property declarations. Nested structures like { colors: { primary: '#blue' } } become --colors-primary CSS variables with proper naming conventions. The flattening process maintains reference to original nesting structure for subsequent reconstruction and access pattern generation.
      </nested-object-flattening>
      <variable-access-reconstruction>
        Flattened variables are reconstructed into nested access objects that mirror the original structure while referencing CSS custom properties. The reconstruction process creates var() function calls with appropriate fallback chains. This enables JavaScript-style property access while leveraging CSS custom property cascade and inheritance behaviors.
      </variable-access-reconstruction>
      <variable-scope-management>
        CSS variables can be scoped to specific elements or declared globally on :root. The variable system integrates with the rule management engine for automatic cleanup and reference counting. Variable changes trigger reactive updates to dependent styles, enabling dynamic theming and responsive design patterns through CSS custom property modifications.
      </variable-scope-management>
    </variable-system>
  </core-architecture>
  <memory-management>
    <caching-strategies>
      <multi-level-caching-system>
        The CSS system employs multiple caching layers: inline cache for css() function results, rule cache for generated CSS content, and variable cache for processed cssVars() objects. Each cache uses hash-based keys derived from input objects and configuration options. Cache invalidation occurs automatically when limits are exceeded, using LRU-style cleanup to maintain memory efficiency.
      </multi-level-caching-system>
      <hash-based-memoization>
        Object hashing enables O(1) cache lookups and deduplication across identical CSS objects. The stringify() function creates deterministic hash keys from nested objects, accounting for property order and nested structures. Hash-based memoization prevents redundant CSS generation and rule processing while maintaining cache coherence across component rerenders.
      </hash-based-memoization>
      <cache-size-management>
        Each cache maintains size limits with automatic cleanup when thresholds are exceeded. The system prioritizes recently used entries while clearing entire caches when limits are reached. This prevents unbounded memory growth during long-running applications while maintaining cache effectiveness for frequently used styles and variables.
      </cache-size-management>
    </caching-strategies>
    <rule-lifecycle-management>
      <automatic-cleanup-system>
        Rule removal occurs automatically through reference counting without requiring manual cleanup calls. The css.remove() function decrements reference counts and removes rules with zero references from DOM stylesheets. This automatic lifecycle management prevents stylesheet bloat and memory leaks during component mounting and unmounting cycles.
      </automatic-cleanup-system>
      <batch-update-coordination>
        Style updates are batched through the batchUpdates() function to minimize DOM manipulations and prevent layout thrashing. Multiple rule changes within the same execution cycle are collected and applied simultaneously. Batching integrates with the reactive system to ensure consistent styling during rapid state changes.
      </batch-update-coordination>
      <dom-injection-optimization>
        CSS content is injected into DOM through dedicated style elements managed by the styleManager() function. Computed properties track rule changes and update style element content only when necessary. This approach minimizes DOM mutations while ensuring style consistency across component updates and reactive state changes.
      </dom-injection-optimization>
    </rule-lifecycle-management>
  </memory-management>
  <rendering-algorithms>
    <css-object-processing>
      <nested-selector-resolution>
        The process() function recursively processes nested CSS objects, generating proper selector hierarchies for pseudo-classes, child selectors, and media queries. Special handling exists for & symbol substitution, keyframe declarations, and at-rule processing. Nested structures are flattened into valid CSS while maintaining semantic meaning and specificity relationships.
      </nested-selector-resolution>
      <property-value-transformation>
        CSS property values undergo transformation to handle special cases: number values receive appropriate units (px for dimensional properties), array values are joined with spaces, and function values create reactive bindings. The transformation process maintains CSS validity while enabling JavaScript-native value representations.
      </property-value-transformation>
      <vendor-prefix-handling>
        Vendor prefixes are applied automatically based on property detection and browser compatibility requirements. The system handles both property prefixing (-webkit-transform) and value prefixing (webkit-gradient). Prefix application occurs during CSS generation without affecting cached object representations.
      </vendor-prefix-handling>
    </css-object-processing>
    <reactive-computation>
      <computed-css-generation>
        CSS content generation uses computed properties that automatically recalculate when underlying rules change. The styleManager() creates reactive pipelines from signal-based rule maps to generated CSS strings. Computed properties provide automatic invalidation and regeneration without manual dependency tracking.
      </computed-css-generation>
      <content-deduplication>
        Generated CSS content undergoes deduplication to prevent identical rule insertion across multiple style elements. Content hashing enables efficient comparison of generated CSS strings. Deduplication operates at both rule and stylesheet levels to minimize DOM style element content and parsing overhead.
      </content-deduplication>
      <lazy-evaluation-optimization>
        CSS generation occurs lazily when rules are actually needed for DOM injection. Initial css() calls may return class names without immediately generating CSS content. Full CSS generation and DOM injection are deferred until the reactive system determines style updates are required for rendering.
      </lazy-evaluation-optimization>
    </reactive-computation>
  </rendering-algorithms>
  <performance-optimizations>
    <hash-based-optimization>
      <deterministic-hashing-algorithm>
        Object hashing uses a deterministic algorithm that accounts for property order, nested structure, and value types. The hash() function creates consistent keys for identical objects regardless of creation context. Deterministic hashing enables reliable cache lookups and rule deduplication across component boundaries and render cycles.
      </deterministic-hashing-algorithm>
      <collision-resistance-strategy>
        Hash collision detection and resolution ensure cache coherence when different objects produce identical hash values. The system uses content comparison as a fallback when hash collisions are detected. Collision resistance maintains cache reliability while preserving performance benefits of hash-based lookups.
      </collision-resistance-strategy>
      <hash-key-optimization>
        Hash keys incorporate configuration options (scoped, name, global) to ensure proper cache separation for different CSS generation contexts. Key composition prevents cache pollution when identical objects are used with different generation options. Optimized key structure minimizes string operations while maintaining cache effectiveness.
      </hash-key-optimization>
    </hash-based-optimization>
    <batched-dom-updates>
      <update-aggregation>
        Multiple CSS rule changes within the same execution cycle are aggregated into single DOM updates through batch processing. The batchUpdates() function collects pending changes and applies them simultaneously. Update aggregation prevents layout thrashing and reduces browser reflow/repaint cycles during rapid style changes.
      </update-aggregation>
      <content-diffing-optimization>
        Style element content updates use content diffing to minimize actual DOM mutations. Only changed CSS rules trigger style element content replacement. Content diffing operates at rule granularity to identify specific changes within larger stylesheets, optimizing update performance for partial style modifications.
      </content-diffing-optimization>
      <reactive-batching-integration>
        DOM update batching integrates with the core reactive system's batching mechanism to ensure consistent timing and ordering. Style updates are coordinated with other reactive updates to maintain application state consistency. Integration ensures style changes are applied within appropriate reactive execution contexts.
      </reactive-batching-integration>
    </batched-dom-updates>
    <memory-efficiency-patterns>
      <reference-counting-optimization>
        Reference counting operations are optimized for common patterns: single-use styles (immediate cleanup), shared styles (efficient reuse), and conditional styles (proper lifecycle management). Counting algorithms minimize overhead while maintaining accurate reference tracking. Optimization patterns reduce memory allocation and garbage collection pressure.
      </reference-counting-optimization>
      <cache-eviction-strategies>
        Cache eviction uses size-based limits with complete cache clearing when thresholds are exceeded. This approach prevents cache management overhead while ensuring memory bounds. Eviction strategies balance cache effectiveness with memory consumption, prioritizing recently accessed entries through temporal locality principles.
      </cache-eviction-strategies>
      <object-pooling-patterns>
        Temporary objects used during CSS generation are pooled and reused to reduce garbage collection pressure. Object pooling applies to hash computation, rule processing, and content generation phases. Pooling patterns minimize allocation overhead during high-frequency style operations while maintaining functional correctness.
      </object-pooling-patterns>
    </memory-efficiency-patterns>
  </performance-optimizations>
  <advanced-algorithms>
    <css-variable-flattening>
      <recursive-object-traversal>
        Variable flattening uses recursive traversal to convert nested objects into flat key-value pairs with proper naming conventions. The flattenVars() function handles arbitrary nesting depth and circular reference detection. Traversal algorithms maintain property paths for subsequent reconstruction while generating valid CSS custom property names.
      </recursive-object-traversal>
      <naming-convention-enforcement>
        Flattened variable names follow CSS custom property conventions with kebab-case conversion and prefix handling. The naming algorithm ensures valid CSS identifiers while preserving semantic meaning from original object structure. Convention enforcement handles special characters and reserved keywords appropriately.
      </naming-convention-enforcement>
      <reconstruction-algorithm>
        Variable reconstruction reverses flattening to create nested access objects with CSS custom property references. The reconstructNested() function rebuilds original object structure while substituting values with var() function calls. Reconstruction maintains property access patterns while leveraging CSS cascade and inheritance behaviors.
      </reconstruction-algorithm>
    </css-variable-flattening>
    <rule-deduplication-engine>
      <content-based-deduplication>
        Rule deduplication operates on generated CSS content rather than input objects to handle semantically identical styles with different representations. Content-based comparison ensures functionally equivalent rules are properly deduplicated regardless of object structure differences. Deduplication algorithms account for selector specificity and CSS cascade rules.
      </content-based-deduplication>
      <selector-normalization>
        Selector normalization ensures consistent rule comparison by standardizing whitespace, property order, and formatting. The normalization process creates canonical representations for deduplication while preserving CSS semantics. Normalized selectors enable accurate rule matching across different generation contexts.
      </selector-normalization>
      <rule-merging-optimization>
        Compatible CSS rules are merged when possible to reduce stylesheet size and parsing overhead. Rule merging algorithms identify opportunities for selector combination and property consolidation. Merging optimization maintains CSS specificity rules while minimizing generated stylesheet size.
      </rule-merging-optimization>
    </rule-deduplication-engine>
    <reactive-style-computation>
      <dependency-tracking-integration>
        Reactive CSS properties integrate with the core effect system for automatic dependency tracking and invalidation. Signal reads within CSS property functions establish reactive dependencies without explicit subscription management. Dependency tracking enables precise updates when only specific style properties change.
      </dependency-tracking-integration>
      <computed-style-invalidation>
        Style invalidation occurs automatically when dependent signals change, triggering recomputation of affected CSS rules. Invalidation algorithms minimize recomputation scope to changed properties while maintaining style consistency. Computed invalidation integrates with batching systems for efficient update scheduling.
      </computed-style-invalidation>
      <effect-cleanup-coordination>
        Reactive style effects are cleaned up automatically when components unmount or style rules are removed. Cleanup coordination ensures proper disposal of signal subscriptions and effect registrations. Effect lifecycle management prevents memory leaks while maintaining reactive behavior during component lifecycle transitions.
      </effect-cleanup-coordination>
    </reactive-style-computation>
  </advanced-algorithms>
  <integration-patterns>
    <component-styling-patterns>
      <scoped-component-styles>
        Component-specific styles use scoped selectors to prevent global namespace pollution and style conflicts. Scoping patterns enable encapsulation while supporting style composition and inheritance. Component styling integrates with the reactive system for dynamic theme application and conditional styling based on component state.
      </scoped-component-styles>
      <style-composition-strategies>
        Multiple CSS objects can be composed through object merging and class name concatenation. Composition strategies handle precedence rules and selector specificity while maintaining style isolation. Advanced composition supports conditional styles, theme variations, and responsive design patterns through object-based APIs.
      </style-composition-strategies>
