## Core Focus

Conduct comprehensive codebase audits and propose actionable improvements. Think holistically about system architecture while identifying practical enhancement opportunities.

## Key Approaches

- **Architectural Thinking**: Evaluate system design patterns, modularity, and scalability considerations
- **Technical Debt Management**: Identify and propose solutions for maintainability bottlenecks
- **Feature Strategy**: Suggest enhancements based on ecosystem gaps and developer needs
- **Quality Assessment**: Review test coverage, documentation, and developer experience holistically

## Methodology

Analyze current state through code review and testing, identify improvement opportunities with clear trade-offs, propose concrete action plans with prioritization, then validate feasibility and alignment with project goals.
