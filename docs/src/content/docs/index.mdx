HellaJS is a collection of simple packages for building fast and lightweight user interfaces. It's designed to be modular, so you can choose the parts you need. The `core` package provides reactivity and additional packages can be used for routing, state management, and more.

``` jsx
const Counter = () => {
  const count = signal(0);

  return (
    <button onclick={() => count(count() + 1)}>{count}</button>
  );
};

mount(Counter, "#counter");

```

      HellaJS is experimental and not yet ready for production use. The API is subject to change, and there are no guarantees of stability. Use at your own risk!

## Philosophy

- **Quick**: Comparable speed to the most popular frameworks.
- **Lightweight**: Tiny bundles due to its modular architecture.
- **Efficient**: Low memory consumption and fast first paint.
- **Simple**: Familiar and friendly developer experience.
- **Composable**: Largely unopinionated and easily extendable.
- **Tested**: Over 145 tests and 95%+ test coverage.
- **Documented**: Clear and concise documentation with examples.


## Core Concepts

The development experience with JSX is familiar to anyone coming from React or Solid, but it's less opinionated and requires no compiler if you use [html](/packages/dom/html) proxy elements.

The core concepts are reactivity and granular DOM updates. [mount](/packages/dom/mount) is a one-time operation, and elements only react when their text content or an attribute is a [signal](/packages/core/signal) or derived function.

Instead of a virtual DOM, HellaJS uses a lightweight node registry, and components are automatically cleaned up after they are removed from the DOM.

## Packages

  {['core', 'dom', 'css', 'resource', 'router', 'store'].map(name => (
    <div class="flex gap-4 items-center" key={name}>
      <p class="min-w-[65px]">{name}</p>
      <img class="mt-0 min-w-[95px]" alt="npm version" src={`https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@hellajs/${name}`} />
      <img class="mt-0" alt="" src={`https://img.shields.io/bundlephobia/minzip/@hellajs/${name}@latest`} />
    </div>
  ))}
