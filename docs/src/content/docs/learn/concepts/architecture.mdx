# Application Architecture

HellaJS's modularity and simplicity allow for various architectural patterns. Here are some recommended approaches.

## Component-Based Structure

Organize your application into small, reusable components. Each component should have a single responsibility.

## State Management

- **Local State**: Use `signal()` for state that is local to a single component.
- **Shared State**: For state that needs to be shared across multiple components, create signals in a separate JavaScript module and export them.
- **Global Store**: For complex applications, use the `@hellajs/store` package to create a centralized, reactive store.

## Feature-Based Folders

For larger applications, consider organizing your code by feature. Each feature directory would contain its own components, stores, and services.

```
src/
├── features/
│   ├── auth/
│   │   ├── components/
│   │   └── authStore.js
│   └── todos/
│       ├── components/
│       └── todosStore.js
├── components/      # Shared, reusable UI components
└── services/        # Global services like API clients
```
