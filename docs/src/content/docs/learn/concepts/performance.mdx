# Performance

HellaJS is designed to be fast by default. Its fine-grained reactivity system avoids the overhead of a virtual DOM and component re-renders.

## Key Performance Characteristics

- **No Virtual DOM**: HellaJS updates the DOM directly, eliminating the need for diffing and patching a virtual tree.
- **Fine-Grained Updates**: Only the specific DOM nodes that depend on a changed signal are updated. The rest of the DOM is untouched.
- **Component Runs Once**: Components are regular JavaScript functions that execute only one time to set up the initial DOM structure and reactive bindings.

## Optimization Techniques

While HellaJS is fast out of the box, you can further optimize your applications:

- **Batching**: Use `batch()` to group multiple signal updates into a single, atomic transaction. This prevents a cascade of intermediate updates and ensures effects run only once.
- **Memoization**: Use `computed()` to cache the results of expensive calculations. The calculation will only re-run if its dependencies change.
- **`untracked()`**: Read a signal's value within a reactive scope without creating a dependency, preventing unnecessary re-runs of effects or computeds.
