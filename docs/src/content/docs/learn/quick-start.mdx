description: Build a simple Todo app with HellaJS using a few core concepts.

import { Aside } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

HellaJS is unopinionated in terms of setup and architecture. All you need to do is install the core and dom packages in any project and have a mount element in your HTML.

```bash
npm install @hellajs/core @hellajs/dom
```

<Aside type="note" title="Template Setup">
  Install one of the [plugins](/plugins) if you're using JSX.
  
  Use the [html](/packages/dom/html) proxy element to avoid a build step.
</Aside>

Then, somewhere in your HTML:

```html
<div id="app"></div>
```

Now, somewhere in your project:


```jsx
import { signal } from "@hellajs/core";
import { mount } from "@hellajs/dom";

const App = () => {
  const count = signal(0);

  return (
    {/* ⚠️ Attach functions for reactivity, don't call them */}
    <button onclick={() => count(count() + 1)}>{count}</button>
  );
};

mount(App, "#app");
```

You can now run your project and see the button that increments the count when clicked.

That's all there is to it!
