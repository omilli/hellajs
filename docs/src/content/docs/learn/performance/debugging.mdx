# Debugging Performance

This guide provides techniques for identifying and fixing performance bottlenecks in your HellaJS applications.

## 1. Browser DevTools Profiler

The most powerful tool for performance debugging is the Performance tab in your browser's developer tools.

- **Record a performance profile** while interacting with your application.
- **Look for long tasks** in the main thread timeline. These are potential bottlenecks.
- **Analyze the flame chart** to see which functions are taking the most time.

## 2. Logging Reactive Updates

You can create a simple helper to log when signals and effects are updated.

```jsx
import { effect } from '@hellajs/core';

function debugEffect(name, fn) {
  effect(() => {
    console.log(`[${name}] running...`);
    const start = performance.now();
    fn();
    const end = performance.now();
    console.log(`[${name}] finished in ${(end - start).toFixed(2)}ms`);
  });
}

// Usage
debugEffect('MyComponentRender', () => {
  // ... your component's reactive logic
});
```

## 3. Identifying Unnecessary Re-runs

If a component is updating more than expected, check for:
- **Unwanted dependencies**: Are you reading a signal in an effect or computed that you don't want to be a dependency? Use `untracked()` to fix this.
- **Lack of batching**: Are multiple, separate signal updates triggering a cascade of effects? Wrap them in `batch()`.

## 4. HellaJS DevTools (Coming Soon)

We are developing browser extensions to provide a visual representation of your application's reactive graph, making it easier to trace how data flows and where updates are triggered.
