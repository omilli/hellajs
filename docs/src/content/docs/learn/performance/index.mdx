## Key Performance Concepts

- **Fine-Grained Reactivity**: Understand how HellaJS avoids expensive re-renders.
- **Batching**: Group state updates to minimize UI work.
- **Memoization**: Cache expensive computations with `computed()`.
- **Code Splitting**: Lazy-load components and features to reduce initial bundle size.

## Prerequisites

- [Reactivity](/concepts/reactivity) - Core concepts of HellaJS reactivity.
- [Best Practices](/guides/getting-started/best-practices) - General development conventions.
