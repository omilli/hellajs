# JSX Transform

HellaJS uses a custom JSX transform (via Babel or Vite/Rollup plugins) to convert JSX syntax into highly optimized JavaScript code. It does not compile to `React.createElement` calls.

## The Goal

The transform is designed to:
- Avoid a Virtual DOM.
- Create direct reactive bindings between state and the DOM.
- Keep the runtime as small and fast as possible.

## Example Transformation

**Input JSX:**
```jsx
const count = signal(0);
const App = () => <div class="counter">Count: {count}</div>;
```

**Simplified Output:**
```javascript
const count = signal(0);
const App = () => {
  const el = document.createElement('div');
  el.className = "counter";
  const text = document.createTextNode("");
  el.appendChild(text);

  // Create a reactive binding
  effect(() => {
    text.textContent = `Count: ${count()}`;
  });

  return el;
};
```
In reality, the output is a VNode structure that the `mount` function uses to create these bindings, but the principle is the same: the transform sets up direct reactive updates.
