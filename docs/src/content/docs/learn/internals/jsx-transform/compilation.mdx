# Compilation & Optimizations

The HellaJS JSX transform performs several optimizations at build time to ensure the runtime code is as efficient as possible.

## Static vs. Dynamic Elements

The compiler analyzes the JSX to determine which parts are static and which are dynamic (i.e., depend on reactive state).

- **Static parts** are created as simple strings or DOM elements once.
- **Dynamic parts** are wrapped in effects or other reactive primitives.

```jsx
const name = signal('HellaJS');

// Here, the `<h1>` and `class` are static.
// Only the text content `{name}` is dynamic.
<h1 class="title">Hello, {name}!</h1>
```

The compiler can create the `<h1>` element with its class once, and only set up an effect to update its `textContent`.

## Attribute Handling

The transform automatically converts camelCase JSX props like `onClick` to their HTML attribute equivalents like `onclick`, and handles special cases like `className` to `class`.
