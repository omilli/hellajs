# The Reactive Graph

The core of HellaJS is its reactive graph, a system that tracks dependencies between reactive values (`signals` and `computeds`) and the side effects (`effects`) that depend on them.

## Key Characteristics

- **Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)**: Dependencies flow in one direction, and there are no circular dependencies.
- **Automatic Dependency Tracking**: When a reactive function (a `computed` or `effect`) is executed, any signal that is read becomes a dependency of that function.
- **Glitch-Free**: Updates are propagated in a way that ensures no computation runs with stale data. An effect will only run after all of its dependencies have been updated.

## How it Works

1.  **Nodes**: Every `signal`, `computed`, and `effect` is a node in the graph.
2.  **Edges**: An edge is created from a signal/computed to a computed/effect when the former is read by the latter.
3.  **Updates**: When a signal is updated, it notifies all its dependents, marking them as "stale". The system then re-runs the stale effects, which in turn may re-evaluate stale computeds they depend on.
