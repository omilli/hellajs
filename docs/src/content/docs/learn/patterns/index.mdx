## When to Use These Patterns

### Component Patterns
Use when you need to:
- Create reusable UI components
- Share logic between components
- Build flexible, composable interfaces
- Avoid prop drilling

### State Patterns
Use when you need to:
- Manage complex application state
- Share data between distant components
- Optimize performance for large datasets
- Implement undo/redo functionality

### Async Patterns
Use when you need to:
- Fetch data from APIs
- Handle loading and error states
- Implement real-time features
- Manage background operations

### Error Patterns
Use when you need to:
- Gracefully handle failures
- Provide meaningful user feedback
- Recover from errors automatically
- Debug production issues

## Pattern Categories

### 🏗️ Structural Patterns
How to organize and compose components
- Container/Presentational separation
- Higher-order component patterns
- Compound component design

### 🔄 Behavioral Patterns
How components interact and communicate
- Observer patterns with signals
- Command patterns for actions
- Strategy patterns for algorithms

### 🎨 UI/UX Patterns
Common interface solutions
- Modal and dialog patterns
- Form handling strategies
- Navigation patterns

### 📊 Data Patterns
Managing and transforming data
- Normalization strategies
- Caching patterns
- Optimistic updates

## Prerequisites

Before exploring these patterns:

- **Core Understanding**: [Reactivity](/concepts/reactivity), [Components](/concepts/components)
- **Essential APIs**: [`signal()`](/api/core/signal), [`computed()`](/api/core/computed), [`effect()`](/api/core/effect)
- **Basic Experience**: Complete the [Tutorial](/guides/getting-started/tutorial)

## Pattern Selection Guide

### Small Applications (< 10 components)
- Focus on **Component Patterns** for reusability
- Use **Local State** patterns for simple data
- Apply **Basic Error Handling** for user feedback

### Medium Applications (10-50 components)
- Implement **State Management** patterns for shared data
- Use **Async Patterns** for API integration
- Apply **Advanced Component** patterns for complex UI

### Large Applications (50+ components)
- Deploy **Advanced State** patterns for complex domains
- Implement **Error Boundaries** for reliability
- Use **Performance** patterns for optimization

## Getting Started

1. **Start with basics** - Learn core component patterns first
2. **Identify pain points** - Where is your current code complex or repetitive?
3. **Apply incrementally** - Introduce patterns one at a time
4. **Measure impact** - Ensure patterns improve, not complicate, your code

## Common Questions

**Q: Should I use all these patterns?**
A: No. Use patterns to solve specific problems, not preemptively.

**Q: Which patterns are most important?**
A: Start with Component Patterns and State Patterns. Add others as needed.

**Q: Can I mix these patterns?**
A: Yes! These patterns complement each other and can be combined effectively.
