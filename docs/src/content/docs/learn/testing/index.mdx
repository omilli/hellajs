## Testing Philosophy

HellaJS's architecture makes testing straightforward:
- **Components are just functions**: Test them by calling them and inspecting the returned structure.
- **Reactivity is predictable**: Test reactive logic by updating signals and asserting the output of computed values.
- **No Virtual DOM**: Test against the actual DOM using standard testing libraries.

## Recommended Tools

- **Test Runner**: [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) or [Jest](https://jestjs.io/)
- **DOM Testing**: [@testing-library/dom](https://testing-library.com/docs/dom-testing-library/intro/)
- **Assertions**: [Chai](https://www.chaijs.com/) or Jest's built-in `expect`.
