A reactive side effect that automatically runs when dependencies change.


```typescript
import { signal, effect } from '@hellajs/core';

const count = signal(0);

// Creates an effect that runs when count changes
const cleanup = effect(() => {
  console.log(`The count is: ${count()}`);
});
// Logs: "The count is: 0" (initial run)

count(1);
// Logs: "The count is: 1"

// Stop the effect from running
cleanup();

// No longer logs anything
count(2);
```
