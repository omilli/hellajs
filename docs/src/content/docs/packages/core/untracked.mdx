Read <a href="/api/reactive/signal">signals</a> inside effects without craeting a dependency.

```typescript
import { signal, effect, untracked } from '@hellajs/core';

const count = signal(0);
const threshold = signal(10);

effect(() => {
  // This creates a dependency on count
  const currentCount = count();

  // This does NOT create a dependency on threshold
  const currentThreshold = untracked(() => threshold());

  console.log(`Count: ${currentCount}, Threshold: ${currentThreshold}`);
});

// Effect runs, logs: "Count: 0, Threshold: 10"

count(1);
// Effect runs, logs: "Count: 1, Threshold: 10"

threshold(20);
// Effect doesn't run, since threshold was read via untracked
```
