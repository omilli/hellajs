description: Familiar JSX templating with function-based reactivity.

import { Tabs, TabItem, Aside } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';


HellaJS has its own flavor of JSX templating, which is similar to React and Solid. It uses a function-based approach to create reactive components.

There's also an [html](/packages/dom/html) proxy element that allows you to use HellaJS without a compiler, which is useful when you want to avoid the overhead of a build step.

<Aside type="note" title="Note">
  <p>
    We'll use the JSX syntax in this guide, but you can also use the [html](/packages/dom/html) proxy element.
  </p>
</Aside>


<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="JSX">
```jsx
const Counter = () => {
  const count = signal(0);

  return (
    <button onclick={() => count(count() + 1)}>{count}</button>
  );
};

mount(Counter, "#counter");
```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Proxy">
```js
const Counter = () => {
  const count = signal(0);

  return html.button({ onclick: () => count(count() + 1) },
    count
  );
};

mount(Counter, '#counter');
```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Components

Components are functions that return a JSX element or an [html](/packages/dom/html) proxy. Any element that uses a signal or derived function for text content or attributes becomes reactive. 

There's no virtual DOM, and [mount](/packages/dom/mount) is a one-time operation. Components have their own reactive scope and are auto-cleaned when removed.

  <p>
  `<p>{content()}</p>` Will render only once.
  
  Pass the reference instead `<p>{content}</p>`.
  </p>
</Aside>



``` jsx
const Counter = (props, children) => {
  // Signals are reactive
  const count = signal(props.count);
  // Derived functions using signals are also reactive
  const doubleCount = () => count() * 2;
  const countClass = () => count() % 2 === 0 ? 'even' : 'odd';

  return (
    {/* ⚠️ Attach functions for reactivity, don't call them */}
    <div class={countClass}>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <p>Double Count: {doubleCount}</p>
      <button onclick={() => count(count() + 1)}>{count}</button>
      {children}
    </div>
  );
};

mount(Counter, "#counter");
```


## Conditionals

Since functions make elements dynamic, you can use plain JavaScript conditionals like `if` or `switch`—just return an element. 

``` jsx
const isShown = signal(true);
//...
<div>
  {() => isShown() ? <p>Shown</p> : ""}
</div>
```
## Loops

Use the HellaJS `forEach` function to work with loops.

``` jsx
const items = ['Item 1', 'Item 2', 'Item 3'];
//...
<div>
  {forEach(items, (item => <p>{item}</p>))}
</div>
```
## Dynamic

Components are just functions, so you can use them dynamically without any extra modules.

``` jsx
const components = {
  profile: () => Profile(props),
  settings: () => Settings(props),
};
const active = signal("profile");
//...
<main>
  {() => components[active()]}
</main>
```

Use the [html](/packages/dom/html) proxy if you want dynamic HTML elements.
``` jsx
const tags = ['div', 'section', 'aside'];
const selectedTag = signal('div');
//...
<main>
  {() => html[selectedTag()]("This is dynamic")}
</main>
```
