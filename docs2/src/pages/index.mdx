## Build Reactive UIs

Create user interfaces that update automatically when data changes. There's no virtual DOM and no complex state management. Just simple, elegant, and reactive code.

```jsx
import { signal } from '@hellajs/core';
import { mount } from '@hellajs/dom';

const Counter = () => {
  const count = signal(0);

  return (
    <button onclick={() => count(count() + 1)}>
      Clicked {count} times
    </button>
  );
};

mount(Counter, "#app");
```

    HellaJS is experimental and evolving rapidly. APIs may change as we refine the developer experience. Perfect for learning and experimentation!

## Choose Your Path

- **🚀 New to HellaJS?** - Start with the [Quick Start](/learn/quick-start) to build your first reactive component in under 5 minutes.
- **📚 Coming from React?** - Check out our [concepts guides](/concepts/reactivity) to understand fine-grained reactivity.
- **🔍 Need something specific?** - Browse the [API reference](/packages/core/signal) for detailed function documentation.
- **🛠️ Ready to build?** - Follow the [Todo Tutorial](/learn/todo-tutorial) to create a complete application.

## Why HellaJS?

### 🚀 **Familiar & Fast**
Write components just like React, but with automatic fine-grained updates. No re-renders, no virtual DOM diffing.

### 📦 **Modular by Design**  
Use only what you need: core reactivity, DOM utilities, routing, state management, or styling. Each package works independently.

### ⚡ **Performance First**
Designed for speed and efficiency. Small bundle sizes, minimal memory usage, fast first paint.

<summary>🔍 **How is this different from React?**</summary>

**React:** Re-renders components when state changes, uses virtual DOM to minimize real DOM updates.

**HellaJS:** Directly binds reactive values to DOM elements. When `signal()` changes, only the specific DOM node updates.

```jsx
// This button text updates automatically - no component re-render
const count = signal(0);
<button>{count}</button>  // Updates when count() changes
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>📊 **Performance & Bundle Size**</summary>

- **Core package**: ~2KB gzipped
- **Full framework**: ~8KB gzipped (comparable to Preact)
- **Memory efficient**: No virtual DOM overhead
- **Fast updates**: Direct DOM manipulation, no reconciliation

*Benchmarks coming soon as we approach stable release.*

## Core Philosophy

HellaJS prioritizes **simplicity** and **developer experience** while delivering **high performance**:

- **Reactive by default** - Data changes automatically update the UI
- **JSX without complexity** - Familiar syntax, but more efficient
- **Modular architecture** - Use only what your application needs  
- **Zero virtual DOM** - Direct DOM updates for maximum performance
- **TypeScript ready** - Full type safety out of the box

## What You'll Build With

- **⚡ Reactivity** - [`signal()`](/packages/core/signal), [`computed()`](/packages/core/computed), [`effect()`](/packages/core/effect) for reactive state management.
- **🌐 DOM Rendering** - [`mount()`](/packages/dom/mount) for rendering components, plus control flow helpers.
- **🛣️ Routing** - [`router()`](/packages/router/router) for client-side navigation and route management.
- **🎨 Styling** - [`css()`](/packages/css/css) for CSS-in-JS with automatic optimization.
