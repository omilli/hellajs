## Features

- **üöÄ Hella Fast**: Fine-grained reactivity, no virtual DOM overhead.
- **üì¶ Hella Small**: Less than 3.5KB gzipped, with a modular architecture.
- **üëå Hella Simple**: Familiar JSX syntax and a minimal API surface.
- **üí™ Zero Dependencies**: Lean and mean, with no external dependencies.
- **‚úÖ TypeScript Ready**: Full TypeScript support out of the box.
- **üß™ Fully Tested**: Over 95% test coverage for reliability.

## Counter Example

```jsx
import { signal } from "@hellajs/core";
import { mount } from "@hellajs/dom";

function Counter() {
  // Reactive signals
  const count = signal(0);
  // Derived state
  const countClass = () => (count() % 2 === 0 ? "even" : "odd");
  const countLabel = () => `Count: ${count()}`;

  // Render JSX
  return (
    <div>
      {/* Functions make element attributes and text reactive */}
      <h1 class={countClass}>{countLabel}</h1>
      {/* Events are delegated to the mount element */}
      <button onClick={() => count(count() + 1)}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  );
}

// Mount the app
mount(Counter, "#counter");
```

## Core Concepts

HellaJS is built on a foundation of powerful, yet simple reactive primitives.

- **‚ö° [Reactivity](https://hellajs.com/learn/concepts/reactivity)**: Fine-grained reactive system with signals, computed values, and effects.
- **üìù [Templates](https://hellajs.com/learn/concepts/templates)**: JSX templates and component patterns for building reactive user interfaces.
- **üíæ [State](https://hellajs.com/learn/concepts/state)**: Local component state and global application state management.
- **üß≠ [Routing](https://hellajs.com/learn/concepts/routing)**: Reactive client-side router with hash support for single-page applications.
- **üé® [Styling](https://hellajs.com/learn/concepts/styling)**: Dynamic CSS classes, inline styles, and CSS-in-JS approaches.
- **üåç [Resources](https://hellajs.com/learn/concepts/resources)**: Reactive Data fetching, caching, and server state management.
